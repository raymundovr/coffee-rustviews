# Coffee Rustviews

[Coffee Reviews](https://gitlab.com/raymundo.vr/coffee-reviews) in ðŸ¦€

__Get a notification about pending Merge Requests for your (team's) projects.__

Got time for a coffee? Why not reviewing some code while enjoying it?

## Requirements

- Rust >= 1.40

## Getting started

1. Clone this project
2. Build the application by executing `cargo build`

## Configuration

The presence of a configuration file is required. JSON and TOML  formats are supported. This file contains all possible configuration options needed to run the project. Refer to the sample files to get an overview of these options.

### Configuring Gitlab settings

Before starting be sure to have obtained a [Gitlab API Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html#authentication) to authenticate the requests.

Once you have the authentication token include it in the configuration file in the `gitlab` section. Example in JSON:

```json
{
    "gitlab": {
        "base_url": "https://gitlab.com/api/v4",
        "token": "here-goes-your-token"
    },
    [...]
}
```
```toml
gitlab.base_url = "https://gitlab.com/api/v4"
gitlab.token = "your-token"
```
Other configuration options are available, please check the [JSON](config.sample.json) and [TOML](config.sample.toml) attached to this project.


### Posting to Slack

An application webhook is required to receive messages in Slack. You can create one by registering an application. Please proceed as specified in the official [Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/).

Once you have your webhook URL include it in the configuration file. Example:
```json
{
    [...]
    "publish": {
        "slack": {
            "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/yourappwebhook-url"
        }
    }
}
```
```toml
publish.slack.webhook_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/yourappwebhook-url"
```

### Posting to Microsoft Teams

To receive the messages a connector for incoming webhook needs to be created in your channel. Proceed as specified in the [Teams documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook).

Once you have registered the connector in your channel you can specify the url in the configuration settings.
```json
{
    [...]
    "publish": {
        "teams": {
            "webhook_url": "https://url.outlook.com/webhooks/your-webhook-url"
        }
    }
}
```
```toml
publish.teams.webhook_url = "https://domain.webhook.office.com/yourwebhookconnector-url"
```

## Running the app

Create a `config.json` or `config.toml` file that would include all your configuration settings.

Then execute:

`cargo run -- -c /path/to/configfile`

This command will print a message indicating the Merge Requests posted and a confirmation on the number of messages posted (all merge requests go in one message).

If all is configured correctly you should be able to see something like

```
Posted 4 Merge Requests. Successful posts: 1
```

And the corresponding message in your channel.

### Config file argument

If you don't specify a path to your config file using `-c /path/to/configfile` the program will assume that a `config.json` resides in the current path.

### Salutation

Currently the messages are preceeded by:

__Hi! There are some Merge Requests to review :)__

### Periodic executions

The best use case scenario is when this script is executed by a Cron job.

Can be quickly resumed as follows.

1. Build the release binary

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```
This creates a target/release folder inside the project's folder that includes the executable file `coffee-rustviews`.

2. Edit your cron jobs to execute the program.

For example
```bash
0 9 * * *  /path/to/target/release/coffee-rustviews -c /path/to/configfile
```
Will execute the script everyday at 09:00 hrs.
